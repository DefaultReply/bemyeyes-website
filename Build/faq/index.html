			<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>How did the idea come about?</h2>
				<p>Hans Jørgen Wiberg, who is visually impaired himself, came up with the idea for the application. Through his work at "The Danish Association of the Blind" he recognized, that visually impaired often need help to cope with smaller everyday tasks. In April 2012 he presented the idea for an application at a startup event in Denmark. At this event he met the rest of the Be My Eyes team. Since 2012 the team has worked diligently to make the app a reality. The app was launched the 15th of January 2015.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>What is Be My Eyes good for?</h2>
				<p>I know what you’re thinking – blind people are so badass, they don’t need help! And it’s true! They navigate entire cities on their own, blind! But even though blind people often have four supersonic senses left, they’re not Sherlocks, and they need help once in a while! Be My Eyes provides that help.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>What is open source?</h2>
				<p>Open source means that the source code (how the app is built in coding) is free to use, change, distribute or whatever you would like to do with it! You will find the code on <a href="https://github.com/bemyeyes">GitHub</a>. The reason we have chosen open source, is because we want to share the concept of Be My Eyes and give talented people the chance to improve it by contributing with new features or fixation of bugs.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>How do visually impaired people use an iPhone?</h2>
				<p>The iPhone has a feature called <a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/voiceover/">VoiceOver</a>, which enables visually impaired to use an iPhone with synthetic speech and touch-based interface. Particularly, iPhone has been perceived as one of the best assisting devices for the visually impaired. It has been widely used as a GPS, to get information about transportation, receive news and much, more. If you would like to learn more about it, you can check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0nvdiRdehw">video</a> made by Tommy Edison.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>How do I get started?</h2>
				<p>Find and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/be-my-eyes-helping-blind-see/id905177575?mt=8">download the app</a> from the Apple's app store, follow the instructions in the app to create a profile and add the languages you speak. Then you should be ready to call or receive a call. It is important to note, that you don't need to have the app open or in the background in order to receive a call.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>What are the points and levels for in the app?</h2>
				<p>The points are awarded to you, when you use the app, answer calls, and share your experiences with Be My Eyes on social media. The points merely work as an incentive. The "levels" indicate your level of experience based on the points. It is only for yourself to see.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>How can I change/add more languages?</h2>
				<p>Right now there are more than 10 times the amount of helpers compared to visually impaired. Therefore we suggest, that helpers only help in their mothertongue. This way we are sure, that the visually impaired always get help from a native speaker. If you are bilingual, you can choose your second language in the settings. Here you can also change the languages you have chosen before.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>Why don't I get requests for help?</h2>
				<p>We are very thankful, that you have signed up. However, since there are more than ten times the amount of seeing helpers than visually impaired users, it might take some time before you receive a call. Nonetheless, we are grateful to see the impressive amount of people willing to help, so please keep your patience, a call will definitely come at some point.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>When I receive a request for help, what should I do?</h2>
				<p>When you receive a call for assistance, you will hear a ringtone and it will look like as if you get a notification. You answer the call by tapping the request or swiping it right.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>How do you prevent misuse/abuse?</h2>
				<p>Unfortunately, as with any app, cases of misuse/abuse are almost impossible to prevent. Therefore, we kindly ask users to report the abusive behavior right after the call. You do that by tapping the "Abuse" button. When you report abusive behavior, the other person will be excluded from the network.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>How do I make sure, that I am not notified during the night?</h2>
				<p>The standard setting only allows you to receive calls from 7 in the morning (7am) to 10 in the evening (10pm) in your local time zone. Therefore, you do not have to worry about receiving calls in the middle of the night. We are working on a feature to personalise the time availability settings.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>How can I upload a photo to my profile?</h2>
				<p>If you have created an account using your email, unfortunately, you are not able to insert a photo. However, if you sign up with your Facebook account, your Facebook picture should be automatically added to your profile.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>Do I need a Twitter account in order to help?</h2>
				<p>You do not need a Twitter account to help; it only provides you with more points if you have it, but it does not restrict or affect your ability to help in any way.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>Do I need to have the app open in order to receive a call?</h2>
				<p>No. You are ready to receive a call as soon as you have created your account and are logged in. You do not need the app to be opened or even running in the background. The standard setting on the app for receiving calls is from 7 in the morning (7am) to 10 in the evening (10pm) in your local time zone. If you do not want to receive the calls during a certain time, you can log-out or use the "Do Not Disturb" function in your phone.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>The app says I have to wait for a connection, what should I do?</h2>
				<p>If you receive the message "waiting to connect", it should not take longer than a minute. If it takes longer than a minute, you should disconnect. If you are a visually impaired user, please try to re-dial. Due to the massive traffic of helpers trying to answer calls simultaneously, there might occur system problems. Please make sure you have a strong signal and a steady connection, as the application requires some bandwidth to show video in a sufficient quality.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>What should I do, if the application is unresponsive?</h2>
				<p>If the application is unresponsive, it is most likely due to server problems. Do not worry, they will get fixed ASAP. Please try it again later.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>What should I do if my app crashes when I try to use it or open it?</h2>
				<p>If you are experiencing this when trying to open the app, please try to open it one more time or delete the app and download it again. If it is crashing while trying to login with Facebook, go to system settings and make sure, that the Be My Eyes app has access to your Facebook account. If the app still crashes, please let us know.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>What should I do if I cannot log-in or log-on using a secondary device?</h2>
				<p>Please find the button on the first screen of the app "Already registered? Log in here." It is written with smaller letters and might be easy to miss. We will make it more user friendly by time.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>How about an Android or Windows version?</h2>
				<p>Currently, Be My Eyes is only available for iOS, but we have plans of developing an Android version. If you wish to be amongst the first ones to get notified about it, please sign up at <a href="http://www.bemyeyes.org/android/">bemyeyes.org/android</a>. We do not have plans about developing a Windows version. However, depending on the future direction, it might be a consideration. Nonetheless, if you would like to participate in making a Be My Eyes client for another platform, please check out our <a href="https://github.com/bemyeyes">GitHub Repository</a> or get in touch on <a href="https://twitter.com/BeMyEyes">Twitter</a>.</p>
