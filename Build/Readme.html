<h2>How to build</h2>

<p>The website is build using <a href="http://hammerformac.com/">Hammer for Mac</a>. In order to build the website you must install this app, clone this repository and add the root folder to Hammer. Everytime a file in the cloned reposity is saved a new build is generated by Hammer. New builds are generated in the <code>/Build</code> folder.</p>

<p>Builds can be viewed by opening the <code>index.html</code> in the <code>Build</code> folder or by install <a href="http://anvilformac.com/">Anvil for Mac</a> to host the site locally. Anvil provides the increased benefit of adding <a href="http://xip.io/">xip.io</a> support so your site can be browsed by other devices on your network.</p>
