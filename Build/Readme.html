<h2>How to build</h2>

<p>The website is build using <a href="http://hammerformac.com/">Hammer for Mac</a>. In order to build the website you must install this app, clone this repository and add the root folder to Hammer. Everytime a file in the cloned reposity is saved a new build is generated by Hammer. New builds are generated in the <code>/Build</code> folder.</p>

<p>Builds can be viewed by opening the <code>index.html</code> in the <code>Build</code> folder or by install <a href="http://anvilformac.com/">Anvil for Mac</a> to host the site locally. Anvil provides the increased benefit of adding <a href="http://xip.io/">xip.io</a> support so your site can be browser by other devices on your network.</p>

<h2>How to deploy</h2>

<p>Any pushes to the <code>production</code> branch of this repository are automatically deployed to S3 by <a href="https://getforge.com/">Forge</a> where the site is hosted. PLEASE PLEASE make an optimized build in Hammer and commit it before pushing to production. This will greatly decrease the size of the hosted files and the speed of the website.</p>
