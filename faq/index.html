			<div class="question">
				<h2>How do blind people use an iPhone?</h2>
				<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/voiceover/">The iPhone has a great feature called VoiceOver</a> which enables people who are completely blind to use an iPhone with synthetic speech and touch based interface.</p>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>How can I help Be My Eyes?</h2>
				<p>First of all we need sighted helpers, if you have an iPhone 4s or newer, you can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/be-my-eyes-helping-blind-see/id905177575">download the app</a> or if you have an Android you can <a href="http://bemyeyes.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=e7bc4d93c409f117307da5764&id=6715c5a0ea">be notified when it's availbale</a>. Volunteering for Be My Eyes is easy and unbinding. You can also help us <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/bemyeyes">translate the app</a> to more languages</p>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>How do you ensure that the system won't get misused?</h2>
				<p>As a new user you will be met by a experienced helper and vice versa. By the end of each session there will be an opportunity to rate or report misuse, both for the helper and the user. People who misuse the system will be excluded from the network.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>Will you make a version for other operating systems?</h2>
				<p>We would love to, but right now it is not possible, because the system we use can only handle video between iPhones. But we know that there are a lot of potential Android and Windows phone users out there.</p>

			<div class="question">
				<h2>What will the price be?</h2>
				<p>We are nonprofit, but there are cost related to keeping Be My Eyes up and running. By September 2015 our initial funding comes to an end, and we will have to come up with a sustainable business model. We consider a subscription model and/or donations.</p>
