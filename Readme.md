## How to build

The website is build using [Hammer for Mac](http://hammerformac.com/). In order to build the website you must install this app, clone this repository and add the root folder to Hammer. Everytime a file in the cloned reposity is saved a new build is generated by Hammer. New builds are generated in the ``/Build`` folder.

Builds can be viewed by opening the ``index.html`` in the ``Build`` folder or by install [Anvil for Mac](http://anvilformac.com/) to host the site locally. Anvil provides the increased benefit of adding [xip.io](http://xip.io/) support so your site can be browsed by other devices on your network.

## Collaboration

We are using [Waffle](https://waffle.io/bemyeyes/bemyeyes-website) to manage Github issues. It has two-way sync by adding and removing tags like:
- Ready – Done discussing, do!
- In progress – Someone is working on this one

You can see priorities on [Waffle](https://waffle.io/bemyeyes/bemyeyes-website) – top = first.
Admins of this repo can make the changes.
